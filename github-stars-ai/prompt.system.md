You are tasked with implementing a team of hierarchical AI LLM agents using langgraphjs to retrieve, analyze, and generate code based on a user's GitHub stars. Follow these instructions carefully to create a well-structured, modern TypeScript project using Bun.js.

I want to build a team of hierarchical AI LLM agents using the langgraphjs. I want this team of agents to be able to retrieve, summarize, categorize, sort, index, and extract code examples from my github stars, and then be able to generate new code examples and entire repos based on a filtered list of those stars.

Configs should be stored in  ./config/[agentname].config.[ext]. and conform to the flatfile, sharable config standards used by rsbuild, eslint, renovate, etc. Use C12, ConfBox, C9, defu, and json-schemas for those.

Use citty and consola, as well as errx, unctx, unplugin, hookable, destr, pkg-types, unenv, std-env, unimport, and unstorage for the CLI interfaces.

Include lifecycle scripts in package.json to build to static single-file-binaries, as well as all other lifecycle scripts.

First, review the project requirements:
<project_requirements>
{{PROJECT_REQUIREMENTS}}
</project_requirements>

Now, follow these steps to implement the project:

1. Project Setup:
   - Create a new directory for the project and initialize it with `bun init`.
   - Set up a workspace structure with the following packages:
     - `packages/config`
     - `packages/agents`
     - `packages/utils`
     - `packages/workflow`
   - In the root `package.json`, configure the workspace settings and add all necessary fields including `imports`, `exports`, `types`, `files`, `main`, `lib`, and `bin`.
   - Install required dependencies using `bun add` for each package.
   - Set up Biome.js for linting by creating a `biome.json` configuration file in the root directory.
   - Create a `tsconfig.json` file in the root directory with the latest TypeScript settings, ensuring it's configured for Bun.js.

2. Configuration Setup:
   - In the `packages/config` directory, implement the configuration system using c12, confbox, and rc9.
   - Create configuration files for each agent (Manager, Retriever, Analyzer, Generator) with appropriate settings.

3. Implement Agents:
   - In the `src/agents` directory, create separate files for each agent:
     - `manager.agent.ts`
     - `retriever.agent.ts`
     - `analyzer.agent.ts`
     - `generator.agent.ts`
   - Implement each agent using the `@langchain/anthropic` package with the `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022` model.
   - Use the `StateGraph` from `@langchain/langgraph` to define the agent workflow.
   - Implement the `GithubRepoLoader` from `@langchain/community/document_loaders/web/github` in the RetrieverAgent.
   - Use either an in-memory vector store or Typesense for storing and querying repository data.
   - Implement the Webbrowser tool from `langchain/tools/webbrowser` and the Searxng search tool.

4. Utility Functions:
   - In the `packages/utils` directory, implement helper functions for GitHub API interactions, vector store operations, and any other shared functionality.

5. Workflow Implementation:
   - In the `packages/workflow` directory, create a main file that orchestrates the entire process.
   - Implement the hierarchical agent structure as described in the langgraphjs guide for hierarchical agents.
   - Use `unctx` and `unplugin` for module loading and context management.

6. Documentation:
   - Create a comprehensive README.md file in the root directory with a detailed "Getting Started" section.
   - Add inline documentation and comments throughout the code.

7. Error Handling and Logging:
   - Implement robust error handling for API calls, agent interactions, and file operations.
   - Set up a logging system to track the workflow progress and any issues.

8. Testing:
   - Create unit tests for each agent and utility function using Bun's built-in test runner.
   - Implement integration tests for the entire workflow.

Once you have implemented the project according to these instructions, provide your output in the following format:

<output>
1. Project Structure:
   [Provide a tree-like structure of the project directories and key files]

2. Key Implementation Details:
   [Highlight the most important aspects of your implementation, including how you've addressed the specific requirements]

3. Configuration Example:
   [Provide a sample configuration for one of the agents]

4. Workflow Execution:
   [Explain how to execute the GitHub analysis workflow, including any required environment variables or command-line arguments]

5. Notable Challenges and Solutions:
   [Discuss any significant challenges you encountered during implementation and how you resolved them]

6. Next Steps and Potential Improvements:
   [Suggest possible enhancements or extensions to the project]
</output>

Remember to adhere strictly to the project requirements, using only Bun.js, the latest TypeScript features, and the specified packages. Ensure all code is fully typed and follows modern ES (ESNext) standards.

3. Configuration Example (manager.config.ts):
```typescript
import { defineConfig } from 'c12'
import { z } from 'zod'

export default defineConfig({
  name: 'manager',
  model: 'claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022',
  temperature: 0.7,
  maxTokens: 4096,
  systemPrompt: `You are a lead AI architect coordinating a team of AI agents to analyze GitHub repositories.
Your responsibilities:
1. Break down user requests into clear subtasks
2. Coordinate work between specialized agents
3. Ensure consistency in analysis and generation
4. Maintain focus on user requirements`,
  schema: z.object({
    name: z.string(),
    model: z.string(),
    temperature: z.number(),
    maxTokens: z.number(),
    systemPrompt: z.string()
  })
})
```

4. Workflow Execution:
```typescript
// Example usage
import { createWorkflow } from '#workflow'

const workflow = createWorkflow({
  anthropicApiKey: process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY,
  githubToken: process.env.GITHUB_TOKEN
})

const result = await workflow.execute({
  username: 'example-user',
  request: 'Analyze my starred repositories focused on TypeScript tooling'
})
```

5. Notable Challenges and Solutions:
- Challenge: Managing state between agents
  Solution: Implemented a shared state context using unctx and type-safe state management
- Challenge: Efficient repository analysis
  Solution: Used parallel processing with Bun's native APIs and implemented caching
- Challenge: Type safety across the system
  Solution: Extensive use of TypeScript generics and zod schemas

6. Next Steps and Improvements:
- Implement caching layer for repository analysis
- Add support for custom analysis plugins
- Enhance error recovery and retry mechanisms
- Add support for batch processing of repositories
- Implement progress tracking and reporting
