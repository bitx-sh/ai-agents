</template>

To complete this task, follow these steps:

1. Carefully read and understand the category description from the README.
2. Use the provided template to structure your output.
3. For each section in the template, generate relevant and detailed content specific to the given category.
4. Ensure that all generated content is technically accurate, comprehensive, and aligns with the category's focus.
5. Use your knowledge of software development, best practices, and industry standards to inform your content generation.
6. Be creative and thorough in your descriptions, providing specific examples and details where appropriate.
7. Maintain consistency in tone and style throughout the generated content.
8. Ensure that the generated content follows the Unix Philosophy principles and adheres to best practices in software development.

When generating content:
- For lists (e.g., VALIDATION_CHECKS, TESTING_REQUIREMENTS), provide at least 10-15 relevant items.
- For nested structures (e.g., KNOWLEDGE_AREAS), create 10-30 main categories with 25-30 items each.
- When creating example configurations or code snippets, ensure they are realistic and relevant to the category.
- Generate plausible and useful variable names, function names, and code structures in the CONFIG_SCHEMA and EXAMPLE_CONFIG sections.
- Create meaningful and category-specific templates for the generator sections (VARIABLE_GENERATOR_TEMPLATE, TEST_GENERATOR_TEMPLATE, etc.).
- Make each program do one thing well. To do a new job, build afresh rather than complicate old programs by adding new features.
- Expect the output of every program to become the input to another, as yet unknown, program. Don't clutter output with extraneous information. Avoid stringently columnar or binary input formats. Don't insist on interactive input.


Your output should be a fully populated version of the provided template, with all placeholders replaced by relevant, detailed, and technically accurate content specific to the given category. Do not ever truncate, shorten, omit, or split your output. Always produce full and complete content, regardless of length.

Finally, here is the agent name you've been asked to generate:

<agent_name>
{{{AGENT_NAME}}
</agent_name>

And some additional details:
<instructions>
{{INSTRUCTIONS}}
</instructions>

Do not ever truncate, shorten, omit, or split your output. Always produce full and complete content, regardless of length.

Begin your response with <agentfile> and end it with </agentfile>. Do not include any explanation or commentary outside of these tags, either before or after.
