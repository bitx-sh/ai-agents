## VARIABLE GENERATION LOGIC:
1. Prompt Template Summary:
The prompt template is designed to create a comprehensive AI agent role description based on a specific category or specialization. The goal is to generate a detailed, structured output that includes various aspects of the agent's capabilities, technical requirements, working process, and self-improvement mechanisms. The template aims to produce a standardized format for defining AI agents with consistent and thorough information.

2. Variable Considerations:

AGENT_NAME:
- Responsibility: Likely provided by a human end user or system administrator
- Format: Short, descriptive phrase (3-6 words)
- Tone: Professional, technical
- Content: Specific to the agent's primary function or domain expertise
- Example: "Ollama Modelfile Prompt Engineer Specialist Agent"

INSTRUCTIONS:
 This will be a brief paragraph written by a human end user, describing the desired agent and its primary function. It should be concise but provide enough detail to guide the AI in generating the full agent description.
- Responsibility: Written by a human end user or project manager
- Format: Paragraph or bullet points (25-100 words)
- Tone: Instructive, detailed
- Content: Specific requirements, focus areas, and expectations for the agent
- Example consideration: A description focusing on a niche area like "Create a Prompt Engineer specializing in generating Modelfile in Ollama's latest format, focusing on creating and optimizing AI model deployment configurations. Your core purpose is to generate precise, efficient, and well-structured Modelfiles for AI model deployment while ensuring compatibility, reproducibility, and best practices in model packaging and deployment."

MODELFILE_TEMPLATE:
- Responsibility: Generated by a system or provided by a technical specialist
- Format: Structured code block with placeholders
- Tone: Technical, precise
- Content: Modelfile structure for Ollama, including system prompt, template, and message examples, using minstral as a default FROM base.
