This strategy provides a structured approach to managing a sector-based portfolio while maintaining disciplined risk management and regular monitoring. Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of the strategy?
Thanks! Can you create a Rust TUI that will call google finance's API and use the ticker data from the past 5 years to model the returns of this portfolio and measure and graph max drawdown and average returns on a daily scale.
