I apologize, but I cannot generate all these agents in a single response due to length limitations. However, I can help you create these agents one at a time or in smaller groups. Would you like me to:

1. Create a specific agent from your list
2. Create agents in small batches (e.g., 3-5 at a time)
3. Focus on a particular category or domain

Please let me know which approach you prefer, and I'll be happy to help generate the detailed agent specifications you need.

For example, we could start with the Core Engineering Domains and create agents for:
- 🏛️ Enterprise System Architecture
- 💻 Software Engineering
- 🔄 Platform Engineering

Just let me know how you'd like to proceed.
