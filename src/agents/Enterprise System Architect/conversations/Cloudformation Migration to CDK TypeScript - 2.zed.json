This will improve the maintainability, scalability, and security of our infrastructure as code.\n\n**Architecture Diagram:**\n\n```markdown\n+---------------+\n|  Source Code  |\n+---------------+\n       |\n       | (IDE or Editor)\n       v\n+---------------+\n|  CloudFormation|\n|  Stacks (Legacy)|\n+---------------+\n       |\n       | ( CloudFormation CLI )\n       v\n+---------------+\n|  AWS CDK      |\n|  (using TypeScript) |\n+---------------+\n       |\n       | ( AWS CLI )\n       v\n+---------------+\n|  AWS Resources |\n|  (CloudFormation) |\n+---------------+\n```\n\n**Components:**\n\n1. **Source Code:** The existing CloudFormation templates and configuration files.\n2. **CloudFormation Stacks (Legacy):** The existing infrastructure as code managed by CloudFormation.\n3. **AWS CDK (using TypeScript):** The new infrastructure as code framework using AWS CDK with TypeScript.\n4. **AWS Resources:** The underlying cloud resources provisioned by CloudFormation.\n\n**Technical Requirements:**\n\n1. Migrate the existing CloudFormation stacks to AWS CDK.\n2. Use TypeScript for the migration.\n3. Ensure seamless integration with existing development workflows (IDEs, editors).\n4. Maintain compatibility with existing infrastructure.\n\n**Design Considerations:**\n\n1. Modularization: Break down complex CloudFormation stacks into smaller, manageable modules.\n2. Reusability: Design components that can be reused across multiple environments and projects.\n3. Scalability: Ensure the new architecture can scale horizontally (add/remove resources) and vertically (increase resource capacity).\n4. Security: Integrate security best practices and compliance requirements throughout the migration.\n\n**Jira User Stories:**\n\n### Epic 1: Migrate CloudFormation Stacks to AWS CDK\n\n#### Story 1: Modularize Existing CloudFormation Templates\n\n* As a developer, I want to break down complex CloudFormation templates into smaller modules for easier maintenance.\n* Acceptance Criteria:\n\t+ Each module has a clear and concise description of its functionality.\n\t+ Modules are organized in a hierarchical structure (e.g., folders).\n* Tasks:\n\t+ Review existing CloudFormation templates.\n\t+ Identify potential areas for modularization.\n\t+ Refactor templates into smaller modules.\n\n#### Story 2: Create AWS CDK Stack Structure\n\n* As a developer, I want to define the overall stack structure using AWS CDK.\n* Acceptance Criteria:\n\t+ A high-level design document outlining the overall stack architecture is created.\n\t+ Each component of the stack has been identified and described.\n* Tasks:\n\t+ Develop a high-level design document describing the stack structure.\n\t+ Define each component's scope, functionality, and dependencies.\n\n#### Story 3: Migrate Modules to AWS CDK\n\n* As a developer, I want to migrate existing modules from CloudFormation to AWS CDK.\n* Acceptance Criteria:\n\t+ Each module has been successfully migrated to AWS CDK.\n\t+ The new stack structure is properly defined using AWS CDK constructs.\n* Tasks:\n\t+ Migrate each module to AWS CDK.\n\t+ Integrate modules into the new stack structure.\n\n#### Story 4: Validate and Test Migration\n\n* As a developer, I want to validate and test the migration to ensure it meets all requirements.\n* Acceptance Criteria:\n\t+ The migration has been successfully completed without errors or regressions.\n\t+ All functionality is preserved and operates as expected in the new environment.\n* Tasks:\n\t+ Run automated tests on the migrated stack.\n\t+ Review logs and monitoring data for any issues.\n\n#### Story 5: Document Migration Process\n\n* As a developer, I want to document the migration process for future reference and improvement.\n* Acceptance Criteria:\n\t+ A comprehensive documentation of the migration process is created.\n\t+ All technical decisions and design choices are clearly explained.\n* Tasks:\n\t+ Write detailed documentation describing the migration process.\n\t+ Record technical decisions and design choices.\n\n### Epic 2: Integrate Migration with Existing Workflows\n\n#### Story 1: Integrate with IDE/Editor\n\n* As a developer, I want to integrate the new AWS CDK stack structure into my existing development workflows (IDEs, editors).\n* Acceptance Criteria:\n\t+ The migration process is integrated seamlessly with my chosen development environment.\n\t+ All dependencies and requirements are properly configured for the migration.\n* Tasks:\n\t+ Configure the IDE/editor integration for AWS CDK.\n\t+ Review dependencies and ensure proper configuration.\n\n#### Story 2: Integrate with Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)\n\n* As a developer, I want to integrate the new stack structure into our existing CI/CD pipeline.\n* Acceptance Criteria:\n\t+ The migration process is properly integrated into the CI/CD pipeline.\n\t+ All automation scripts and workflows are updated for the new environment.\n* Tasks:\n\t+ Configure CI/CD integration with AWS CDK.\n\t+ Review and update automation scripts as needed.\n\n**Epics and Stories Breakdown:**\n\nThe two epics cover the core aspects of the migration:\n\nEpic 1 focuses on migrating CloudFormation stacks to AWS CDK, including breaking down complex templates into smaller modules, creating a new stack structure with AWS CDK constructs, migrating each module, and validating the results.\n\nEpic 2 emphasizes integrating the migrated stack structure with existing development workflows (IDEs, editors) and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines to ensure seamless operation.\n\nThe stories within these epics cover specific requirements for each phase of the migration:\n\n1.
