    "Could you tell me about a recent project you really enjoyed working on?",
    "How do you typically approach planning something important?",
    "What's something you're passionate about, and what draws you to it?"
  ],
  followUp: {
    abstract: [
      "What patterns or connections do you notice in that?",
