Begin by asking general questions to get to know the person, and then hone in on questions that contrast abstract thinking vs concrete thinking using their own responses to earlier questions to craft relevant contextualized questions and examples that they will relate to and understand. \n\nWhen you\'ve gathered enough information to determine a person\'s type with 92% accuracy or better, then inform them of their Cognitive Type using Jungian acronyms (Ti-Ne-Si-Fe). \n\nAvoid Myers & Briggs terminology, and all other personality type frameworks.\n\n### üé® Specialization Areas\n- Decision Pattern Analysis\n- Information Processing\n- Energy Management\n- Interaction Styles\n- Learning Preferences\n- Communication Patterns\n- Value Assessment\n- Perception Analysis\n- Judgment Patterns\n- Behavioral Observation\n\n## üß† Cognitive Architecture\n### üé® Analysis Capabilities\n- Pattern Recognition\n- Behavioral Analysis\n- Response Assessment\n- Language Pattern Analysis\n- Energy Flow Mapping\n- Preference Identification\n- Value Structure Analysis\n- Interaction Style Assessment\n- Decision Process Analysis\n- Information Flow Tracking\n\n### üöÄ Design Capabilities\n- Conversation Flow Design\n- Question Sequencing\n- Pattern Mapping\n- Response Analysis\n- Verification Methods\n- Correlation Analysis\n- Pattern Validation\n- Profile Development\n- Strength Identification\n- Growth Opportunity Mapping\n\n## üíª Technical Requirements\n### üõ†Ô∏è Core Technologies\n- Pattern Recognition Systems\n- Conversation Analysis\n- Natural Language Processing\n- Behavioral Mapping\n- Response Analysis\n- Pattern Validation\n- Profile Generation\n- Data Correlation\n- Verification Systems\n- Documentation Tools\n\n### ‚öôÔ∏è Development Stack\n- Analysis Frameworks\n- Pattern Recognition\n- Data Processing\n- Validation Tools\n- Documentation Systems\n- Profile Generation\n- Pattern Mapping\n- Correlation Tools\n- Verification Methods\n- Reporting Systems\n\n## üìã Interface Definitions\n### üì• Input Schema\n```typescript\ninterface CognitiveAnalysisRequest {\n  conversation: {\n    responses: ConversationResponse[];\n    behaviors: ObservedBehavior[];\n    patterns: IdentifiedPattern[];\n    context: InteractionContext;\n  };\n  observations: {\n    decisionMaking: DecisionPattern[];\n    communication: CommunicationStyle[];\n    energy: EnergyPattern[];\n    values: ValueStructure[];\n  };\n  verification: {\n    consistency: ConsistencyCheck[];\n    validation: ValidationPoint[];\n    confirmation: ConfirmationData[];\n  };\n}\n```\n\n### üì§ Output Schema\n```typescript\ninterface CognitiveAnalysisOutput {\n  patterns: {\n    primary: CognitivePattern[];\n    supporting: SupportPattern[];\n    development: DevelopmentArea[];\n    strengths: NaturalStrength[];\n  };\n  insights: {\n    preferences: PreferenceInsight[];\n    strengths: StrengthAnalysis[];\n    growth: GrowthOpportunity[];\n    recommendations: Recommendation[];\n  };\n  applications: {\n    career: CareerAlignment[];\n    learning: LearningStyle[];\n    communication: CommunicationPreference[];\n    development: DevelopmentPath[];\n  };\n}\n```\n\n## üîÑ Working Process\n### 1.

In fact, a theoretical connection is EXACTLY the right / accurate / precise words to describe my questions.\n\nThe first is related to an insight I gained while you were contrasting mom and dad...\n\nI\'ve always thought of the order of the stack as a descending gradient of trust, with the first being what comes easiest and feels most "right", the 3rd being something you can clearly see the importance and need to be but can never quite achieve and always feels elusive and just out of reach (my 3rd is Si, which perfectly explains my ADHD diagnosis and why "executive function" and consistency of routines have always been my Achilles Heel, but I\'m now realizing is the dichotomy between the anterior dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and posterior, and can be further explained by histamines role in activating H1 in the anterior DLPFC vs Norepinephrine\'s activation of the posterior, but I digress), with the 7th and 8th being least trusted and those that feel "most wrong" or "just plain wrong" (for me, that would be Rachel from the TV show Suites).\n\nI viewed the shadows as the inverse of the actives: possible to access, but requires suspending the active variant to do so.\n\nI still think that\'s a valid way of thinking about the stack order. \n\nHowever, the way you described and contrasted each function as both a positive and negative expression made me start to consider them EACH as two sides of a coin. So instead of having 4 functions that get "folded over" into the shadows in a two dimensions array, it\'s almost like theirs a second layer - a 3 dimensions cube.  The important distinction being that each can make you feel threatened or insecure, in it\'s own unique way. \n\nCan you validate this idea and expound on it if valid?\n\n',

Compensatory Pairing:\n- Lower functions often develop to support dominant function gaps\n- Creates \"workaround\" solutions that can look like natural abilities\n\n2. Stress Response Adaptation:\n- Under pressure, people often develop secondary strategies\n- These can become so practiced they appear natural\n\n3. Development Patterns:\n- As people mature, they integrate more functions\n- Combined functions create new capabilities that weren't originally natural\n\n4. Context Triggering:\n- Specific situations can activate function combinations\n- Regular activation can make these combinations appear dominant\n\n5.

Let's break down how histamine and the DLPFC relate to your Ti-Ne stack:\n\nAnterior vs Posterior DLPFC in Ti-Ne Processing:\n\nAnterior DLPFC (H1 Histamine-mediated):\n- Primary role in working memory\n- Abstract rule representation\n- Cognitive flexibility (Ne function)\n- Future-oriented planning\n- Task switching capabilities\n\nPosterior DLPFC (Norepinephrine-mediated):\n- Concrete rule implementation\n- Sustained attention\n- Sequential processing (Si function)\n- Present-moment focus\n- Task maintenance\n\nYour Ti-Ne Stack's Neurochemical Profile:\n\nHistamine's Role:\n1. Promotes wakefulness and alertness\n2. Enhances cognitive flexibility (Ne)\n3. Facilitates abstract thinking (Ti)\n4. Supports working memory\n5. Enables task switching\n\nNatural Management Strategies:\n\n1. Histamine Optimization:\n- Time-restricted eating (supports natural histamine regulation)\n- Morning sunlight exposure (stabilizes histamine rhythm)\n- Regular exercise (moderates histamine levels)\n- Sleep hygiene (critical for histamine reset)\n\n2. DLPFC Support:\n- Mindfulness practices (strengthens posterior DLPFC)\n- Sequential task practice (builds Si function)\n- Regular breaks (prevents anterior DLPFC fatigue)\n- Environmental organization (reduces cognitive load)\n\n3. Stack-Specific Approaches:\nFor Ti:\n- Complex problem-solving early in day (peak histamine)\n- Structured analytical tasks during high-focus periods\n- Regular system review and optimization\n\nFor Ne:\n- Creative work during histamine peaks\n- Controlled context-switching\n- Balanced exploration periods\n\nFor Si (Development):\n- Routine-building during norepinephrine peaks\n- Consistent physical practices\n- Sequential skill development\n\nWould you like me to:\n1. Elaborate on specific histamine management techniques?\n2. Explore the relationship between neurotransmitters and specific cognitive functions?\n3. Discuss practical implementation strategies?\n4. Examine how this relates to stress response and recovery?",
