# üëã Hello! I'm your Systems and Platform Architect

I'm specialized in designing scalable, modular system architectures with expertise in:

- Platform architecture design and optimization
- Modular TypeScript CLI development
- AWS cloud infrastructure using CDK
- Jira project management and workflow
- Comprehensive technical documentation

## How I Can Help You

I can assist with translating business requirements into robust technical solutions, breaking down complex systems into logical components, and ensuring your architecture prioritizes security, scalability, and maintainability.

Whether you need help with:
- Designing a new system architecture
- Refactoring an existing platform
- Creating modular TypeScript CLIs
- Setting up AWS infrastructure with CDK
- Structuring technical documentation
- Planning Jira workflows for technical projects

I'll provide detailed diagrams, implementation timelines, and thorough documentation for any solution I propose.

## What can I help you architect today?
Hello Systems Architect,

We're looking to modernize our current deployment pipeline and architecture as code solution which is built on python + *.properties files  and mostly spaghetti-code that gets glued together into extremely inefficient cloudformation templates with very little cohesion.

We're looking to begin the design planning and strategizing discussions around a new, modular, typescript-based cli "development and cloud toolkit" (a frontend typescript CLI, a backend tRPC deployment and provisioning server, and a CDK Constructs based "managed cloud template" for a shared "common account" that we manage and provide platform-level IaC to the various BU's we support, which we hope to base on a highly customized AWS CDK / Projen / JSII template). This will be called "LUIGI 3.0" as the overall project name, and the cli will be something like LUIGI opskit or cloudctl. 

We're building this at an megacorp enterprise that uses artifactory, github, jenkins core, Azure AD OICD, AWS Cloud managed accounts, and various other requirements and regulations.


We're looking to use AWS as our cloud provider and want to leverage CDK constructs to "wrap" and provide managed IaC for our internal-only BU customers whom we support. Our development team is familiar with TypeScript and Node.js, so we'd prefer solutions that align with these technologies.

Our current immediate need is a high level Jira project plan, with epics and stories, to help us research, scope, design, plan, and manage this project. There's going to be a lot of design decisions we'll need to make as a team which will require researching and strategizing together, so what I need from you right now is:

1. A comprehensive github project README.md describing the various components of the project (A modular, plugin-based, hookable, configuration loader, transformer, and hierarchical merge strategies like unjs/C12 or something similar and library-based-plugins for subcommands - this cli should be able to self-initialize both itself and the configuration file; A CDK project template that loads that configuration file and uses to scaffold / generate the CDK platform IaC project, and finally a plan or strategy for importing / converting / merging existing AWS CFN stacks and resources). This project README.md needs to describe the concepts and components but remain high level.

2. We need high level, basic, initial Jira epics and stories (mostly as high level epic and story "templates" that will allow us to wrap our head all the components and decisions we need to think through before we can even create the implementation stories.

3. Markdown based ADR records that we can use to document any design decisions we'll make.

Once again, I need as much of the "technical and administrative documentation" work to be templated out so that we can begin filling in the actual specific details and planning the additional stories and documenting the specific implementation details in this next sprint (which begins tomorrow).

I hope these materials give you a solid foundation to start your sprint tomorrow. Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of these deliverables, or is there any other documentation you'd need to kick off the project effectively?
Thank you for all of that. It is indeed extensive. My team is new to AWS CDK, as well as all the concepts around a composable, modular, plugin-based CLI. Can we flesh those concepts out in Jira Epics + ADRs more?

Here's some examples and packages I'd like to incorporate or consider and review as a team. I'm just going to throw an unstructured list of items and thoughts out that and would like you to make them cohesive instances like you did everything above - that should good to you?

- trpc
- twoslash
- the whole unjs / nuxt / vite ecosystem (I don't like angular, react, or anything .net, or python)
- typespec
- prompting the user in the terminal for configuration values and then generating a configuration object like standard nuxt / vue / vueuse / etc projects
- bun and the entire bun ecosystem
- devcontainers
- release-please
- renovate
- biome


The concept here is I want our customers to have an experience similar to what https://fly.io provides - run `npx cloudctl init` and it'll prompt them for config values, scan their existing code base, and then generate them all the scripts and infrastructure as code required to deploy their project, and then they can run `npx cloudctl deploy dev` and it'll build, push, and run their project in our managed cloud environment.

Can you help me continue creating the Jira epics, stories, and ADR records to plan out and document this System Platform Architecture Design?

## Additional Conceptual Documentation for AWS CDK

For your team that's new to AWS CDK, here's a section outlining key concepts and approaches for your README:

```markdown
## AWS CDK Concepts for the LUIGI 3.0 Platform

### Key CDK Concepts

#### Constructs
Constructs are the basic building blocks of AWS CDK apps. They represent cloud components and encapsulate everything AWS CloudFormation needs to create the component.

- **L1 Constructs (CfnResource)**: Direct representations of CloudFormation resources
- **L2 Constructs**: Higher-level abstractions with sensible defaults
- **L3 Constructs (Patterns)**: Purpose-built patterns for common architectures

LUIGI's platform library will focus primarily on creating L3 constructs that encapsulate company best practices and security requirements.

#### Stacks
Stacks are the unit of deployment in CDK - similar to CloudFormation stacks. They're defined separately from constructs and can be deployed individually.

#### App
The root construct that serves as the entry point for the CDK application.

#### Aspects
Aspects are a way to apply cross-cutting behaviors to constructs and their children. We'll use aspects to enforce tagging, security best practices, and naming conventions.

### LUIGI CDK Architecture

Our CDK implementation will follow these principles:

1. **Layered Abstraction**: 
   - Core infrastructure layer
   - Service pattern layer
   - Application deployment layer

2. **Environment Separation**:
   - Development environment
   - Testing environment
   - Staging environment
   - Production environment

3. **Compliance by Default**:
   - Security groups with least privilege
   - IAM roles with minimum permissions
   - Encryption enabled by default
   - Logging and monitoring baked in

4. **Deployment Pipeline Integration**:
   - CDK bootstrapping automation
   - Diff generation before deployment
   - Approval workflows for production changes
   - Rollback capability
```

## Modular CLI Architecture Conceptual Documentation

To help your team understand the modular CLI concepts:

```markdown
## Modular CLI Architecture Concepts

The LUIGI CLI follows a modular, plugin-based architecture inspired by modern JavaScript tools like the unjs ecosystem. This architecture provides flexibility, extensibility, and maintainability.

### Core Architecture Components

#### Command Registry
The central registry where commands are registered, discovered, and executed. It maintains the command hierarchy and relationships.

#### Plugin System
Allows extending the CLI with new commands, hooks, and functionality without modifying the core codebase.

#### Configuration Management
A hierarchical configuration system inspired by unjs/C12 that merges configuration from multiple sources with proper precedence.

#### Hook System
Provides extension points throughout the command lifecycle where plugins can inject functionality:
- `beforeValidation`
- `afterValidation`
- `beforeExecution`
- `afterExecution`
- `onError`
- `onSuccess`

#### Middleware Pipeline
Commands run through a series of middleware functions that handle cross-cutting concerns like:
- Authentication
- Logging
- Telemetry
- Error handling
- Configuration loading

### Plugin Development

Plugins follow a consistent structure:
```typescript
interface LuigiPlugin {
  name: string;
  version: string;
  commands?: LuigiCommand[];
  hooks?: Record<string, HookFunction[]>;
  middleware?: MiddlewareFunction[];
  config?: ConfigurationSchema;
  activate?: (context: PluginContext) => Promise<void>;
  deactivate?: (context: PluginContext) => Promise<void>;
}
```

### Configuration System

The configuration system uses a layered approach:
1. Default configurations
2. Global user configuration
3. Project configuration 
4. Environment-specific overrides
5. Command-line arguments

Configurations are validated against JSON schemas, and sensitive values are automatically handled securely.

This additional content should help your team better understand the AWS CDK concepts and modular CLI architecture while providing more detailed planning materials in the form of Jira epics, stories, and ADR templates. The expanded documentation reflects the fly.io-like experience you described and incorporates the technologies you mentioned (tRPC, twoslash, unjs ecosystem, TypeSpec, Bun, devcontainers, release-please, renovate, and Biome).

Would you like me to further expand on any specific area of the project plan?
