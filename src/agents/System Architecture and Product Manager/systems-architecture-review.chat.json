This will be called \"LUIGI 3.0\" as the overall project name, and the cli will be something like LUIGI opskit or cloudctl. \n\nWe're building this at an megacorp enterprise that uses artifactory, github, jenkins core, Azure AD OICD, AWS Cloud managed accounts, and various other requirements and regulations.\n\n\nWe're looking to use AWS as our cloud provider and want to leverage CDK constructs to \"wrap\" and provide managed IaC for our internal-only BU customers whom we support. Our development team is familiar with TypeScript and Node.js, so we'd prefer solutions that align with these technologies.\n\nOur current immediate need is a high level Jira project plan, with epics and stories, to help us research, scope, design, plan, and manage this project. There's going to be a lot of design decisions we'll need to make as a team which will require researching and strategizing together, so what I need from you right now is:\n\n1. A comprehensive github project README.md describing the various components of the project (A modular, plugin-based, hookable, configuration loader, transformer, and hierarchical merge strategies like unjs/C12 or something similar and library-based-plugins for subcommands - this cli should be able to self-initialize both itself and the configuration file; A CDK project template that loads that configuration file and uses to scaffold / generate the CDK platform IaC project, and finally a plan or strategy for importing / converting / merging existing AWS CFN stacks and resources). This project README.md needs to describe the concepts and components but remain high level.\n\n2. We need high level, basic, initial Jira epics and stories (mostly as high level epic and story \"templates\" that will allow us to wrap our head all the components and decisions we need to think through before we can even create the implementation stories.\n\n3. Markdown based ADR records that we can use to document any design decisions we'll make.\n\nOnce again, I need as much of the \"technical and administrative documentation\" work to be templated out so that we can begin filling in the actual specific details and planning the additional stories and documenting the specific implementation details in this next sprint (which begins tomorrow)."

README:\n\n```markdown\n## AWS CDK Concepts for the LUIGI 3.0 Platform\n\n### Key CDK Concepts\n\n#### Constructs\nConstructs are the basic building blocks of AWS CDK apps. They represent cloud components and encapsulate everything AWS CloudFormation needs to create the component.\n\n- **L1 Constructs (CfnResource)**: Direct representations of CloudFormation resources\n- **L2 Constructs**: Higher-level abstractions with sensible defaults\n- **L3 Constructs (Patterns)**: Purpose-built patterns for common architectures\n\nLUIGI's platform library will focus primarily on creating L3 constructs that encapsulate company best practices and security requirements.\n\n#### Stacks\nStacks are the unit of deployment in CDK - similar to CloudFormation stacks. They're defined separately from constructs and can be deployed individually.\n\n#### App\nThe root construct that serves as the entry point for the CDK application.\n\n#### Aspects\nAspects are a way to apply cross-cutting behaviors to constructs and their children. We'll use aspects to enforce tagging, security best practices, and naming conventions.\n\n### LUIGI CDK Architecture\n\nOur CDK implementation will follow these principles:\n\n1. **Layered Abstraction**: \n   - Core infrastructure layer\n   - Service pattern layer\n   - Application deployment layer\n\n2. **Environment Separation**:\n   - Development environment\n   - Testing environment\n   - Staging environment\n   - Production environment\n\n3. **Compliance by Default**:\n   - Security groups with least privilege\n   - IAM roles with minimum permissions\n   - Encryption enabled by default\n   - Logging and monitoring baked in\n\n4. **Deployment Pipeline Integration**:\n   - CDK bootstrapping automation\n   - Diff generation before deployment\n   - Approval workflows for production changes\n   - Rollback capability\n```\n\n## Modular CLI Architecture Conceptual Documentation\n\nTo help your team understand the modular CLI concepts:\n\n```markdown\n## Modular CLI Architecture Concepts\n\nThe LUIGI CLI follows a modular, plugin-based architecture inspired by modern JavaScript tools like the unjs ecosystem. This architecture provides flexibility, extensibility, and maintainability.\n\n### Core Architecture Components\n\n#### Command Registry\nThe central registry where commands are registered, discovered, and executed. It maintains the command hierarchy and relationships.\n\n#### Plugin System\nAllows extending the CLI with new commands, hooks, and functionality without modifying the core codebase.\n\n#### Configuration Management\nA hierarchical configuration system inspired by unjs/C12 that merges configuration from multiple sources with proper precedence.\n\n#### Hook System\nProvides extension points throughout the command lifecycle where plugins can inject functionality:\n- `beforeValidation`\n- `afterValidation`\n- `beforeExecution`\n- `afterExecution`\n- `onError`\n- `onSuccess`\n\n#### Middleware Pipeline\nCommands run through a series of middleware functions that handle cross-cutting concerns like:\n- Authentication\n- Logging\n- Telemetry\n- Error handling\n- Configuration loading\n\n### Plugin Development\n\nPlugins follow a consistent structure:\n```typescript\ninterface LuigiPlugin {\n  name: string;\n  version: string;\n  commands?: LuigiCommand[];\n  hooks?: Record<string, HookFunction[]>;\n  middleware?: MiddlewareFunction[];\n  config?: ConfigurationSchema;\n  activate?: (context: PluginContext) => Promise<void>;\n  deactivate?: (context: PluginContext) => Promise<void>;\n}\n```\n\n### Configuration System\n\nThe configuration system uses a layered approach:\n1. Default configurations\n2. Global user configuration\n3. Project configuration \n4. Environment-specific overrides\n5. Command-line arguments\n\nConfigurations are validated against JSON schemas, and sensitive values are automatically handled securely.\n```\n\nThis additional content should help your team better understand the AWS CDK concepts and modular CLI architecture while providing more detailed planning materials in the form of Jira epics, stories, and ADR templates. The expanded documentation reflects the fly.io-like experience you described and incorporates the technologies you mentioned (tRPC, twoslash, unjs ecosystem, TypeSpec, Bun, devcontainers, release-please, renovate, and Biome).\n\nWould you like me to further expand on any specific area of the project plan?"
