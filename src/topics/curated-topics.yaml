  short_description: Backbone.js is a JavaScript library for building modern web apps and services.
  description: "**Backbone.js** supplies structure to JavaScript-heavy applications by providing models with key-value binding and custom events, collections with a rich API of enumerable functions, views with declarative event handling, and connects it all to your existing application over a RESTful JSON interface. Backbone.js was originally extracted from the Rails application [DocumentCloud](http://www.documentcloud.org/). Philosophically, Backbone is an attempt to discover the minimal set of data-structuring (models and collections) and user interface (views and URLs) primitives that are generally useful when building web applications with JavaScript. Backbone is a library, not a framework. Synchronous events are used as the fundamental building block over constantly polling data. The main pars of Backbone are:\n* Events\n* Models – Wraps a row of data in business logic. \n* Collections – A group of models on the client-side, with sorting/filtering/aggregation logic. \n* Router (+ History)\n* Views (+ Client-side Templates) – A logical, re-usable piece of UI. Often, but not always, associated with a model.\n* Sync – Synchronization between frontend and REST API backend"

  description: |-
    Julia Sets are mathematical objects relating to the field of complex dynamics. In general, Julia sets are studied in parallel to Fatou sets, as they are complementary sets defined from a complex function.
    To be specific, in a metric space $(X,d)$, a Fatou set of a map $f: X \to X$ is the maximal open subset of $X$ on which the family of iterates $\lbrace f^n \rbrace$ is equicontinuous, and the Julia set is its complement in $X$.

    To approximate images of these sets, a common approach is to iterate the function of interest over some subset of the complex plane, which often yield beautiful fractals.

    Stenography is a form of shorthand writing/typing that can achieve speeds of over 200 words per minute. Unlike typing, where you usually press one key down at a time to output a single character at a time, machine stenography involves pressing multiple keys down at a time to produce a syllable, word, phrase or more. This allows people to write text at much higher speeds, such as for transcription or captioning. People also use stenography for writing, programming, and day-to-day computer use.

It therefore serves a similar purpose to protocols like XMPP, but is not based on any existing communication protocol.

  description: |-
    Passkeys are a form of passwordless user authentication for websites and apps, that is designed to provide a high level
    of security by leveraging public key infrastructure. Unlike passwords, no shared secret is exchanged between the user
    and a service. Instead, the public key is sent to the server, while the private key is stored in the user’s device.

    To verify the user’s identity, users can use biometric data, such as a fingerprints or facial recognition, instead of
    relying on a user-generated password. This makes it much more difficult for attackers to gain unauthorized access to an
    account, as passkeys are two-factor-authentication (2FA) by default. Concisely, they avoid a range of
    password-based attacks, including phishing, by providing an additional layer of security.

    A **regular expression** (shortened as **regex** or **regexp**), sometimes referred to as rational expression, is a sequence of characters that specifies a match pattern in text. Usually such patterns are used by string-searching algorithms for "find" or "find and replace" operations on strings, or for input validation.

    Regular expression techniques are developed in theoretical computer science and formal language theory. They are used in search engines, in search and replace dialogs of word processors and text editors, in text processing utilities such as sed and AWK, and in lexical analysis. Regular expressions are also supported in many programming languages.

    Different syntaxes for writing regular expressions have existed since the 1980s, one being the POSIX standard and another, widely used, being the Perl syntax.

  description: "**JSON:API** is a specification for how a client should request that resources be fetched or modified, and how a server should respond to those requests. JSON:API is designed to minimize both the number of requests and the amount of data transmitted between clients and servers. This first draft was extracted from the JSON transport implicitly defined by Ember Data’s REST adapter. In general, Ember Data’s goal is to eliminate the need for ad-hoc code per application to communicate with servers that communicate in a well-defined way. The REST Adapter in Ember Data implicitly defined a protocol that custom servers could implement to get a drop-in client for all of their resources. The goals of the media type are to balance:\r\n\r\n* A generic media type that can work across a broad set of use cases, including the generally used relationship types\r\n* Similarity to existing server-side framework practices (and human readability for debugging)\r\n* Ease of implementation on the server side\r\n* Ease of implementation on the client side\r\n\r\nThis specification reached a stable version 1.0 on May 29, 2015."

  description: In computer programming, the **async/await** pattern is a syntactic feature of many programming languages that allows an asynchronous, non-blocking function to be structured in a way similar to an ordinary synchronous function, and is primarily intended to provide opportunities for the program to execute other code while waiting for a long-running, asynchronous task to complete, usually represented by promises or similar data structures.

    **Media Queries** are a way to target browsers by certain characteristics, features, and user preferences, then apply styles, or run other code based on those things. They are a key part of responsive web design, as they allow you to create different layouts depending on the size of the viewport, but they can also be used to detect other things about the environment your site is running on, for example whether the user is using a touchscreen rather than a mouse. Media queries are used for the following:
    * conditionally apply styles with the CSS `@media` and `@import` at-rules
    * target specific media for the `<style>`, `<link>`, `<source>`, and other HTML elements with the `media=` attribute
    * test and monitor media states using the `Window.matchMedia()` and `EventTarget.addEventListener()` methods

    A media query is composed of an optional media type and any number of media feature expressions, which may optionally be combined in various ways using logical operators.
    * Media types define the broad category of device for which the media query applies. The type is optional except when using the not or only logical operators.
        * **all:** Suitable for all devices.
        * **print:** Intended for paged material and documents viewed on a screen in print preview mode.
        * **screen:** Intended primarily for screens.
    * Media features describe a specific characteristic of the user agent, output device, or environment. Media Queries Level 4 groups 18 media features into 5 categories.
        * **Viewport/Page Characteristics**
        * **Display Quality**
        * **Color**
        * **Interaction**
        * **Video-prefixed:** The spec references user agents, including TVs, that render video and graphics in two separate planes that each have their own characteristics. _(upcoming Media Queries Level 5)_
    * Logical operators can be used to compose a complex media query: not, and, and only. You can also combine multiple media queries into a single rule by separating them with commas.

    **Agile** is a software development methology. Popularized in the 2001 Manifesto for Agile Software Development, these values and principles were derived from and underpin a broad range of software development frameworks, including Scrum and Kanban.

    The following 12 Principles are based on the Agile Manifesto:
    1. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through the early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
    2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage.
    3. Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
    4. Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
    5. Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
    6. The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
    7. Working software is the primary measure of progress.
    8. Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
    9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
    10. Simplicity–the art of maximizing the amount of work not done–is essential.
    11. The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
    12. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

  display_name: Parsing
  short_description: Parsing is the process of analyzing a string of symbols conforming to the rules of a formal grammar.
  description: 'A grammar describes the syntax of a programming language, and might be defined in Backus-Naur form (BNF). A lexer performs lexical analysis, turning text into tokens. A parser takes tokens and builds a data structure like an abstract syntax tree (AST). The parser is concerned with context: does the sequence of tokens fit the grammar? A compiler is a combined lexer and parser, built for a specific grammar.'

  short_description: A CSS Module is a CSS file where class names are scoped locally by default.
  description: |-
    CSS Modules are CSS files in which all class names and animation names are scoped locally by default. They compile to a low-level interchange format called [Interoperable CSS](https://github.com/css-modules/icss), but are written like normal CSS files. The ability to explicitly state dependencies eliminates the need to avoid naming conflicts in the global scope.

    For a more colorful introduction, see [this blog post](https://glenmaddern.com/articles/css-modules), which was written by one of the authors of the project near the time of its release.

    LocalStorage is a JavaScript object that allows storing arbitrary key-value pairs in the web browser as an alternative to cookies&mdash;another alternative if the data in question goes beyond key-value pairs is to use the IndexedDB.

    `localStorage` data is specific to the protocol of the document. In particular, for a site loaded over HTTP (e.g., http://example.com), `localStorage` returns a different object than `localStorage` for the corresponding site loaded over HTTPS (e.g., https://example.com).

  short_description: SEO is the process of improving the quality and quantity of website traffic to a website or a web page from search engines.
  description: As an Internet marketing strategy, search engine optimization considers how search engines work, the computer-programmed algorithms that dictate search engine behavior, what people search for, the actual search terms or keywords typed into search engines, and which search engines are preferred by their targeted audience. SEO is performed because a website will receive more visitors from a search engine when websites rank higher on the search engine results page (SERP). These visitors can then potentially be converted into customers.

  description: |-
    **DOM** (short for **D**ocument **O**bject **M**odel) is a cross-platform and language-independent interface that treats an HTML or XML document as a tree structure wherein each node is an object representing a part of the document. The DOM represents a document with a logical tree. Each branch of the tree ends in a node, and each node contains objects. DOM methods allow programmatic access to the tree; with them one can change the structure, style or content of a document. Nodes can have event handlers (also known as event listeners) attached to them. Once an event is triggered, the event handlers get executed.

    The principal standardization of the DOM was handled by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), which last developed a recommendation in 2004. WHATWG took over the development of the standard, publishing it as a living document. The W3C now publishes stable snapshots of the WHATWG standard.

    In HTML DOM (Document Object Model), every element is a node:
    * A document is a document node.
    * All HTML elements are element nodes.
    * All HTML attributes are attribute nodes.
    * Text inserted into HTML elements are text nodes.
    * Comments are comment nodes.

  short_description: TeX is a typesetting system used in the production of technical books and papers.
  description: TeX is a typesetting system created by Donald Knuth at Stanford University in 1978. TeX works by reading a source file containing text and macro definitions which instruct the TeX engine how to typeset the document. It also reads TFM files containing character widths, ligatures, and other information relevant to a particular font. After processing the source document, TeX outputs a DVI file which is a device-independent binary file containing the positions of all characters in the document. The DVI file is then supposed to be processed by a device-specific program that combines the DVI file with the necessary fonts to create something that can be sent to a printer. Nowadays it is more common to use one of the extensions to TeX, e.g. pdfTeX which outputs a pdf file instead of a DVI file.

    Object-oriented programming has several advantages over procedural programming:
    * OOP provides a clear structure for the programs
    * OOP helps to keep the code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself", and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug
    * Logic can be abstracted, encapsulated, composed, inherited and decoupled

The protocol is widely used in applications such as email, instant messaging, and voice over IP, but its use in securing HTTPS remains the most publicly visible.

    The TLS protocol aims primarily to provide security, including privacy (confidentiality), integrity, and authenticity through the use of cryptography, such as the use of certificates, between two or more communicating computer applications. It runs in the presentation layer and is itself composed of two layers: the TLS record and the TLS handshake protocols.

    TLS builds on the now-deprecated SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) specifications (1994, 1995, 1996) developed by Netscape Communications for adding the HTTPS protocol to their Navigator web browser.

    **GitOps** is an operational framework that takes DevOps best practices used for application development such as version control, collaboration, compliance, and CI/CD, and applies them to infrastructure automation. GitOps uses Git repositories as a single source of truth to deliver infrastructure as code.

    # GitOps delivers:
    * A standard workflow for application development
    * Increased security for setting application requirements upfront
    * Improved reliability with visibility and version control through Git
    * Consistency across any cluster, any cloud, and any on-premise environment

    # Key components of a GitOps workflow

    There are four key components to a GitOps workflow, a Git repository, a continuous delivery (CD) pipeline, an application deployment tool, and a monitoring system.
    * The Git repository is the source of truth for the application configuration and code.
    * The CD pipeline is responsible for building, testing, and deploying the application.
    * The deployment tool is used to manage the application resources in the target environment.
    * The monitoring system tracks the application performance and provides feedback to the development team.

    * Set of classes that comprises the tree
    * CSS generator that generates a CSS line for the object tree
    * Code map generator for the CSS changes made#

    There are official tools making it possible to use PostCSS with build systems such as [Webpack](/topics/webpack), [Gulp](/topics/gulp), and [Grunt](/topics/grunt). There is also a console interface available. [Browserify](/topics/browserify) or Webpack can be used to open PostCSS in a browser.

    The complete plugin list can be found on postcss.parts, with some examples listed below.
    * [Autoprefixer](/topics/autoprefixer) to add and clear [browser prefixes](/topics/vendor-prefix).
    * [CSS Modules](/topics/css-modules) to get [CSS selectors](/topics/css-selectors) isolated and code organized. It is supplied as part of Webpack.
    * [stylelint](/topics/stylelint) to analyze CSS code for mistakes and check style consistency.
    * stylefmt fixes the CSS code according to the stylelint settings.
    * PreCSS to perform some Sass/Less preprocessing functions.
    * postcss-preset-env to emulate features from unfinished CSS specification drafts.
    * [cssnano](/topics/cssnano) to make CSS smaller in size by getting rid of the spaces and rewriting the code.
    * [RTLCSS](/RTLCSS) to change CSS code so that the design should be suitable for right-to-left writing (such is applied in Arabic and Hebrew).
    * postcss-assets, postcss-inline-svg and postcss-sprites to work with graphics.

A number of companies are offering or have announced RISC-V hardware, open source operating systems with RISC-V support are available and the instruction set is supported in several popular software toolchains.


    Notable features of the RISC-V ISA include a load–store architecture, bit patterns to simplify the multiplexers in a CPU, IEEE 754 floating-point, a design that is architecturally neutral, and placing most-significant bits at a fixed location to speed sign extension. The instruction set is designed for a wide range of uses. The base instruction set has a fixed length of 32-bit naturally aligned instructions, and the ISA supports variable length extensions where each instruction could be an any number of 16-bit parcels in length. Subsets support small embedded systems, personal computers, supercomputers with vector processors, and warehouse-scale 19 inch rack-mounted parallel computers.

    **Continuous Deployment** (**CD**)  is a software engineering approach in which software functionalities are delivered frequently and through automated deployments.

    Continuous deployment contrasts with continuous delivery (also abbreviated CD), a similar approach in which software functionalities are also frequently delivered and deemed to be potentially capable of being deployed, but are actually not deployed. As such, continuous deployment can be viewed as a more complete form of automation than continuous delivery.

That kind of abstraction makes it possible to have different implementations with the same public methods so the class using it, doesn't need to care which of the implementations is used. This is also especially useful for [unit testing](/topics/unit-testing).

    IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) is a peer-to-peer distributed file system that seeks to connect all computing devices with the same system of files.

    In some ways, IPFS is similar to the World Wide Web, but IPFS could be seen as a single BitTorrent swarm, exchanging objects within one Git repository. In other words, IPFS provides a high-throughput, content-addressed block storage model, with content-addressed hyperlinks. This forms a generalized Merkle directed acyclic graph (DAG).

    IPFS combines a distributed hash table, an incentivized block exchange, and a self-certifying namespace. IPFS has no single point of failure, and nodes do not need to trust each other, except for every node they are connected to. Distributed Content Delivery saves bandwidth and prevents distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, a problem common with HTTP.

    **Single-page applications** (**SPA**) are client-side applications that don't route via different pages but rather combine the logic for different contents into one page. This was historically achieved via hashbang URI fragments (`#!`). With the introduction of the [`pushState` API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History/pushState), this state can now be properly used within the browser history, in bookmarks and sharing.

    Another important point for SPA was the lack of proper [SEO](https://github.com/topics/seo) but developers and frameworks found ways around that.

    Legend goes, that dotfiles were invented when `ls` used to skip files and directories starting with a `.` (dot). As a result, files that begin with such a character were not shown when listing using `ls` — i.e. it was a "hidden" file. Since dotfiles are usually user-specific, a predestined place for them is the `$HOME` directory.

    Commonly used files are for example: `.bashrc`, `.zshrc` or `.vimrc`.

  description: |-
    **Cross-origin resource sharing** (**CORS**) is a mechanism that allows restricted resources on a web page to be accessed from another domain outside the domain from which the first resource was served. CORS also relies on a mechanism by which browsers make a "preflight" request to the server hosting the cross-origin resource, in order to check that the server will permit the actual request. In that preflight, the browser sends headers that indicate the HTTP method and headers that will be used in the actual request. For security reasons, browsers restrict cross-origin HTTP requests initiated from scripts. For example, `fetch()` and `XMLHttpRequest` follow the same-origin policy. This means that a web application using those APIs can only request resources from the same origin the application was loaded from unless the response from other origins includes the right CORS headers.

    # Resource types
    * Invocations of `fetch()` or `XMLHttpRequest`
    * Web Fonts (for cross-domain font usage in `@font-face` within CSS), so that servers can deploy TrueType fonts that can only be loaded cross-origin and used by websites that are permitted to do so
    * WebGL textures
    * Images/video frames drawn to a canvas using `drawImage()`
    * CSS shapes from images
    * scripts
    * iframes

  description: |-
    **Continuous delivery** (**CD**) is a software engineering approach in which teams produce software in short cycles, ensuring that the software can be reliably released at any time and, following a pipeline through a "production-like environment", without doing so manually. It aims at building, testing, and releasing software with greater speed and frequency. The approach helps reduce the cost, time, and risk of delivering changes by allowing for more incremental updates to applications in production. A straightforward and repeatable deployment process is important for continuous delivery.

    Continuous delivery contrasts with continuous deployment (also abbreviated CD), a similar approach in which software is also produced in short cycles but through automated deployments even to production rather than requiring a "click of a button" for that last step. As such, continuous deployment can be viewed as a more complete form of automation than continuous delivery.
